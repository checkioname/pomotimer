The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into focused intervals separated by short breaks, promoting productivity and reducing mental fatigue.





#### Future plans & usage

For the future, I plan to integrate this code with my custom bar, also I plan to send notifications using the gtk library. Currently the bar is made with Ags and typescript, maybe I rewrite it to ro or rust one day
